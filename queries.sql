-- Instructions:
--   Write your SQL query beneath each comment block.
--   Do NOT modify the comment markers (-- Q1, -- Q2, etc.) — the autograder uses them.
--   Test each query locally: psql -h localhost -U postgres -d testdb -f queries.sql

-- ============================================================

-- Q1: Employee Directory with Departments
-- List all employees with their department name, sorted by department (asc) then salary (desc).
-- Expected columns: first_name, last_name, title, salary, name
-- SQL concepts: JOIN, ORDER BY

-- select * from departments
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, e.title, e.salary, d.name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
ORDER BY d.name ASC, e.salary DESC;


-- -- Q2: Department Salary Analysis
-- -- Total salary expenditure by department. Only departments with total > 150,000.
-- -- Expected columns: name, total_salary
-- -- SQL concepts: GROUP BY, HAVING, SUM
SELECT d.name, SUM(e.salary) AS total_salary
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
GROUP BY d.name
HAVING SUM(e.salary) > 150000;


-- -- Q3: Highest-Paid Employee per Department
-- -- For each department, find the employee with the highest salary.
-- -- Expected columns: name, first_name, last_name, salary
-- -- SQL concepts: Window function (ROW_NUMBER or RANK), CTE
WITH RankedEmployees AS (
    SELECT d.name, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.salary,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY d.name ORDER BY e.salary DESC) AS rn
    FROM employees e
    JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
)
SELECT name, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM RankedEmployees
WHERE rn = 1;


-- -- Q4: Project Staffing Overview
-- -- All projects with employee count and total hours. Include projects with 0 assignments.
-- -- Expected columns: project_name, employee_count, total_hours
-- -- SQL concepts: LEFT JOIN, GROUP BY, COALESCE
SELECT p.name,
       COUNT(DISTINCT pa.employee_id) AS employee_count,
       COALESCE(SUM(pa.hours_allocated), 0) AS total_hours
FROM projects p
LEFT JOIN project_assignments pa ON p.project_id = pa.project_id
GROUP BY p.project_id;


-- -- Q5: Above-Average Departments
-- -- Departments where average salary exceeds the company-wide average salary.
-- -- Expected columns: name, avg_salary
-- -- SQL concepts: CTE
WITH CompanyAvg AS (
    SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
),
AboveAvgDepartments AS (
    SELECT d.name, AVG(e.salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees e
    JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
    GROUP BY d.name
    HAVING AVG(e.salary) > (SELECT avg_salary FROM CompanyAvg)
)
SELECT * FROM AboveAvgDepartments;



-- -- Q6: Running Salary Total
-- -- Each employee's salary and running total within their department, ordered by hire date.
-- -- Expected columns: name, first_name, last_name, hire_date, salary, running_total
-- -- SQL concepts: Window function (SUM OVER)
SELECT d.name, e.first_name, e.last_name, e.hire_date, e.salary,
       SUM(e.salary) OVER (PARTITION BY d.name ORDER BY e.hire_date) AS running_total
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
ORDER BY d.name, e.hire_date;


-- -- Q7: Unassigned Employees
-- -- Employees not assigned to any project.
-- -- Expected columns: first_name, last_name, name
-- -- SQL concepts: LEFT JOIN + NULL check (or NOT EXISTS)
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.employee_id NOT IN (SELECT employee_id FROM project_assignments);


-- -- Q8: Hiring Trends
-- -- Month-over-month hire count.
-- -- Expected columns: hire_year, hire_month, hires
-- -- SQL concepts: EXTRACT, GROUP BY, ORDER BY
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hire_date) AS hire_year,
       EXTRACT(MONTH FROM hire_date) AS hire_month,
       COUNT(*) AS hires
FROM employees
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM hire_date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM hire_date)
ORDER BY hire_year, hire_month;


-- -- Q9: Schema Design — Employee Certifications
-- -- Design and implement a certifications tracking system.
-- --
-- -- Tasks:
-- -- 1. CREATE TABLE certifications (certification_id SERIAL PK, name VARCHAR NOT NULL, issuing_org VARCHAR, level VARCHAR)
-- -- 2. CREATE TABLE employee_certifications (id SERIAL PK, employee_id FK->employees, certification_id FK->certifications, certification_date DATE NOT NULL)
-- -- 3. INSERT at least 3 certifications and 5 employee_certification records
-- -- 4. Write a query listing employees with their certifications (JOIN across 3 tables)
-- --    Expected columns: first_name, last_name, certification_name, issuing_org, certification_date
CREATE TABLE certifications (
    certification_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name             VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    issuing_org      VARCHAR(255),
    level            VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE employee_certifications (

    employee_id       INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES employees(employee_id),
    certification_id  INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES certifications(certification_id),
    certification_date DATE NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO certifications (name, issuing_org, level) VALUES
('Project Management Professional (PMP)', 'PMI', 'Advanced'),
('Certified Data Analyst', 'Data Institute', 'Intermediate'),
('AWS Certified Solutions Architect', 'Amazon', 'Advanced');

INSERT INTO employee_certifications (employee_id, certification_id, certification_date) VALUES
(1, 1, '2022-05-15'),
(2, 2, '2023-01-20'),
(3, 3, '2021-11-10'),
(4, 1, '2022-08-30'),
(5, 2, '2023-03-05');

SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, c.name AS certification_name, c.issuing_org, ec.certification_date
FROM employee_certifications ec
JOIN employees e ON ec.employee_id = e.employee_id
JOIN certifications c ON ec.certification_id = c.certification_id;
